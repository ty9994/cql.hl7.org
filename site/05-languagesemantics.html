<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section contains more detailed information relating to the intended semantics of the Clinical Quality Language. These topics are specifically relevant for readers interested in building translation, semantic validation, or evaluation applications for CQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the semantics are described here with reference to the representation defined by the ELM, but because CQL syntax is equivalent to ELM, the semantics apply to CQL as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="clinical-data-retrieval-in-quality-artifacts"><a class="anchor" href="#clinical-data-retrieval-in-quality-artifacts"></a>1. Clinical Data Retrieval in Quality Artifacts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section discusses the problem of clinical data retrieval in the clinical quality space in general, and how the problem is addressed in the CQL specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="defining-clinical-data"><a class="anchor" href="#defining-clinical-data"></a>1.1. Defining Clinical Data</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem of determining what data is required in the evaluation of an artifact containing arbitrary queries against the data model is equivalent to the problem of query containment from database theory. This problem is known to be undecidable for arbitrary queries of the relational algebra, but is also shown to be both decidable and equivalent to the problem of query evaluation for the restricted class of conjunctive queries (Foundations of Databases, Abiteboul, Hull, Vianu).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the health quality domains of measurement and improvement, this problem is further complicated by the problem of terminology mapping. The meaning of a particular clinical statement is represented with a vocabulary consisting of codes which determine the type of statement being represented. For example, a diagnosis clinical statement may be classified using the ICD-10 vocabulary, identifying the specific diagnosis represented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order for health quality artifacts to operate correctly, the meaning of each clinical statement, as identified by the vocabularies involved, must be preserved. However, this meaning is often represented in different vocabularies in different systems. A mapping between the vocabularies is therefore required in order to facilitate expression and evaluation of the artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, clinical data is represented in differing schemas across various clinical data sources, and must therefore be mapped structurally into the clinical data model used by an artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These problems collectively constitute what is referred to as the “curly braces problem” in the Arden space. This problem arises because of the difficulty in defining the structural and semantic aspects of the data involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution to this problem proposed by the CQL specification is to create a well-defined and relatively simple interface between the clinical data provided by data sources, and the usage of that data within the artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, all clinical data within a CQL artifact is represented using a common, standard data model. This allows content to be authored without regard to the specific data models used by various clinical data sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, all references to clinical data within a quality artifact are represented using a specific type of expression that only allows a well-defined set of clinically relevant criteria to be used to reference the data. The purpose of this restriction is two-fold: First, it allows the data required for evaluation to be determined solely by inspection of the artifact. And second, it allows for easy and reliable implementation of the interface between the evaluation engine and the clinical data source, because the criteria used to request information from the clinical data source are simple and well-defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, by using standard terminologies within this data interface, the CQL specification can guarantee that any given clinical statement referenced in an artifact has the same meaning as the data that is provided to the artifact from the clinical data source. At a high level, this is the terminology problem; ensuring that the vocabularies used within the artifact are accurately mapped to the vocabularies used by the clinical data source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These three motivating factors inform the design of the <em>retrieve</em> expression (<em>Retrieve</em> element in ELM) used within the CQL specification.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="conformance-levels"><a class="anchor" href="#conformance-levels"></a>1.2. Conformance Levels</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though CQL and ELM are intended to be used with a standard data model, there are many possibilities for variance in the way that data is provided, even within a particular model. This problem leads to the potential for artifacts to reference properties within the model that may or not be provided within a given specific instance of clinical data. To address this potential problem, the retrieve elements within ELM specify not only the type of the data (meaning the specific model type being retrieved), but optionally a template, or profile identifier that further constrains the data that is expected in a given retrieve. If a template identifier is provided, then the retrieve expression is expected to return only data that matches the constraints in the given template.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider the following retrieve element:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;operand xsi:type="Retrieve"
  dataType="quick:Condition"
  templateId="qicore-condition"
  codeProperty="code"&gt;
  &lt;codes xsi:type="ValueSetRef" name="Other Female Reproductive Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;/operand&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the data type is specified as "<span class="id">quick:Condition</span>", indicating that the result of the retrieve is a list of Condition instances. In addition, each instance must conform to the profile defined by the identifier "<span class="id">qicore-condition</span>".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help communicate validity of an artifact for a specific use, this specification defines two conformance levels related to this use of templates:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="strict-conformance"><a class="anchor" href="#strict-conformance"></a>1.2.1. Strict Conformance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A quality artifact can be said to be strictly conforming if all references to clinical statement model properties (elements and attributes of model types) within the artifact are explicitly constrained by the templates used in the retrieves.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="loose-conformance"><a class="anchor" href="#loose-conformance"></a>1.2.2. Loose Conformance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A quality artifact can be said to be loosely conforming if the artifact references properties that are not explicitly constrained by the templates used in the retrieves. This is not to say that the artifact is necessarily invalid, just that the instances of clinical data provided to the retrieve may or may not contain the elements referenced by properties within the artifact.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="language-capabilities"><a class="anchor" href="#language-capabilities"></a>1.2.3. Language Capabilities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the scope of CQL, and the various implementation options for different features of the language, implementations may find it useful to advertise the language capabilities they support. The following list is a summary of language capabilities of CQL:</p>

<p>Table 5‑A - Description of the data defined by each retrieve</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These criteria are designed to allow the implementation environment to communicate the data requirements for an artifact, or group of artifacts, to a consumer to allow the consumer to gather all and only the relevant clinical information for transport to the evaluation environment. This supports the near-real-time clinical decision support scenario where the evaluation environment is potentially separate from the medical records system environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support further reducing the overall size of data required to be transported, the following steps can be taken to combine retrieve descriptors that deal with the same type of clinical data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, create a retrieve context for each unique type of retrieve using the retrieve data type (and context type, template identifier, code path, and date path) for each retrieve. Note that if the determination here involves dynamic information, the retrieve is not considered “initial” and could result in additional data being requested by the engine in order to complete the evaluation. An implementation environment may opt to restrict artifacts to only those that contain statically determined data requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, for each retrieve, add the codes to the matching retrieve context (by data type), recording the associated date range, if any, for each code. Note that the empty set of codes should be represented as the single code “ALL” for the purposes of this method. As date ranges are recorded, they must be merged so that for each code in each retrieve context, no two date range intervals overlap or meet. If the retrieve has any includes, they are added to the retrieve context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the date ranges for each code within each unique retrieve context are determined, the unique set of date ranges for all codes is calculated, accumulating the set of associated codes. Each unique date range for the context then results in a final descriptor. As part of this process, the “ALL” placeholder code is replaced with the empty set of codes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process produces a set of clinical data descriptors with the following structure:</p>

<p>Collectively, these descriptors then represent the minimum initial data requirements for the artifact, with any overlapping requests for the same type of data collapsed into a single request descriptor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that for the purposes of this method, the notion of the Clinical Data Type must be inclusive of the attributes used for filtering the codes and date ranges. For example, a retrieve of <em>Condition</em> data filtered by <em>code</em> must be considered separately from a retrieve of <em>Condition</em> data filtered by <em>severity</em>.</p>

<p>The retrieve construct includes several paths to the elements of the clinical data:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>id</strong>: The "key" element, an element that provides a unique identifier for the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>code</strong>: The "code" element, a terminology-valued element</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>date</strong>: A date-valued element</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>context</strong>: The "context key" element, an element that identifies the relationship to the context</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these paths can be specified in terms of a <em>property</em>, meaning the actual name of the element, or a <em>path</em>, meaning the name of a search path, such as an index, that can be used to access the data. Both mechanisms are allowed to ensure that data models that define search paths using indexes that do not necessarily match the data elements can be supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, consider a data model that defines an <code>Observation</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">Observation
{
  id: string,

}

ObservationComponent
{
  code: Concept,
  value: Quantity
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow searching by component codes, consider further that this data model defines a search path, called <code>component-code</code> that allows searching for observations that have a component with a given code. In this case, <code>component-code</code> is not an element of Observation, or of ObservationComponent, so it&#8217;s insufficient to specify a code property. To support this capability, the <code>codeSearch</code> element of the retrieve is used:</p>

<h2 id="expression-language-semantics"><a class="anchor" href="#expression-language-semantics"></a>2. Expression Language Semantics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to completely specify the semantics of the expression logic defined by CQL, the intended execution model for expressions must be clearly defined. The following sections discuss the conceptual components of the expression language, and how these components are defined to operate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="data-model-1"><a class="anchor" href="#data-model-1"></a>2.1. Data Model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data model for CQL provides the overall structure and definition for the types of operations and capabilities that can be represented within the language. Note that the schema itself is layered into a core expression schema, and a more specific, clinical expression schema. The expression schema deals with defining the core operations that are available without respect to any specific model. The clinical expression schema then extends those operations to include references to clinical data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that although the expression language deals with various categories of types, these are only conceptually defined within the expression language schema. There is no expectation within the core expression language that any particular data model be used, only that whatever concrete data model is actually used can be concretely mapped to the type categories defined within CQL. Because these type categories are extremely broad, this allows the CQL expression language component to be used with a large class of concrete data models without modifying the underlying specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="values-1"><a class="anchor" href="#values-1"></a>2.1.1. Values</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>value</em> within CQL represents some piece of data. All values are of some <em>type</em>, which designates what operations can be performed on the value. There are four categories of types within CQL:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Simple types – Types representing simple values such as strings, integers, dates, and decimals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured types – Types representing composite values consisting of sets of named properties, each of which has a declared type, that may or may not have a current value of that type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collection types – Types representing lists of values of some declared type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interval types – Types representing an interval of some declared type, called the <em>point</em> type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choice types - Types representing values from a set of possible types</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="simple-types"><a class="anchor" href="#simple-types"></a>2.1.2. Simple Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simple types allow for the representation of simple, atomic types, such as integers and strings. For example, the value <strong>5</strong> is a value of type <em>Integer</em>, meaning that it can be used in operations that require integer-valued input such as addition or comparison.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that because CQL defines a set of basic supported types, an implementation must map these types to the equivalent types in the selected data model. Ideally, this mapping would occur as part of the data access layer to isolate the mapping and minimize complexity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="structured-types"><a class="anchor" href="#structured-types"></a>2.1.3. Structured Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Structured types allow for the representation of composite values. Typically, these types correspond to the model types defined in the clinical data model used for the artifact. Structured types are defined as containing a set of named properties, each of which are of some type, and may have a value of that type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with simple types, the core expression layer does not define any structured types, it only provides facilities for constructing values of structured types and for operating on structured values.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="collection-types"><a class="anchor" href="#collection-types"></a>2.1.4. Collection Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Collection types allow for the representation of lists and sets of values of any type. All the values within a collection are expected to be of the same type.</p>

<p>Collections may be empty, and are defined to be 0-based for indexing purposes.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="interval-types"><a class="anchor" href="#interval-types"></a>2.1.5. Interval Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interval types allow for the representation of ranges over some point type. For example, an interval of integers allows the expression of the interval 1 to 5. Intervals can be open or closed at the beginning and/or end of the interval, and the beginning or end of the interval can be unspecified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core expression layer does not define any interval types, it only provides facilities for constructing values of interval types, and for operating on intervals.</p>

<h4 id="choice-types"><a class="anchor" href="#choice-types"></a>2.1.6. Choice Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choice types allow for the representation of elements that may be any of a possible list of types. A given value at run-time will always be of a specific type, so a choice type is only a compile-time construct that allows for data models that contain elements with multiple possible types, or for the results of expressions where the result may be any of a possible set of types (e.g. a union of different types).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="language-elements"><a class="anchor" href="#language-elements"></a>2.2. Language Elements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expression language represented by the ELM is defined as an Abstract Syntax Tree. Whereas a traditional language would have syntax and require lexical analysis and parsing, using the ELM exclusively allows expressions to be represented directly as trees. This removes potential ambiguities such as operator order precedence, and makes analysis and processing of the expressions in the language much easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concretely, this is accomplished by defining the language elements as classes in a UML model. Each language element is represented by a type in the UML model. For example, the <em>Literal</em> class represents the appearance of a literal expression, and has attributes for specifying the type of the literal, as well as its actual value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arguments to operations are represented naturally using the hierarchical structure of the model. For example, the <em>Add</em> operator is represented as a <em>BinaryExpression</em> descendant, indicating that the operation takes two arguments, each of which is itself an expression.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This general structure allows expressions of arbitrary complexity to be built up using the language elements defined in the schema. Essentially, the language consists of only two kinds of elements: 1) Expressions, and 2) Expression Definitions (including Functions).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each expression returns a value of some type, and an expression or function definition allows a given expression to be defined with an identifier so that it can be referenced in other expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These expressions and expression definitions are then used throughout the CQL specification wherever logic needs to be defined within an artifact.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="semantic-validation"><a class="anchor" href="#semantic-validation"></a>2.3. Semantic Validation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Semantic Validation of an expression within CQL is the process of verifying that the meaning of the expression is valid. This involves determining the type of each expression, and verifying that the arguments to each operation have the correct type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process proceeds as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graph of the expression being validated is traversed to determine the result type of each node. If the node has children (operands) the type of each child is determined in order to determine the type of the node.

<p>All logic in CQL is represented as <em>expressions</em>. The language is pure functional, meaning no operations are allowed to have side effects of any kind. An expression may consist of any number of other expressions and operations, so long as they are all combined according to the semantic rules for each operation as described in the <a href="#semantic-validation">Semantic Validation</a> (5.2.3) section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the language is pure functional, every expression and operator is defined to return the same value on every evaluation within the same artifact evaluation. In particular this means:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>All clinical data returned by request expressions within the artifact must return the same set on every evaluation. An implementation would likely use a snapshot of the required clinical data in order to achieve this behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invocations of non-deterministic operations such as Now() and Today() are defined to return the timestamp associated with the evaluation request, rather than the clock of the engine performing the evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once an expression has been semantically validated, its return type is known. This means that the expression is guaranteed to return either a value of that type, or a <em>null</em>, indicating the evaluation did not result in a value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, operations are defined to result in null if any of their arguments are null. For example, the result of evaluating 2 <span class="sym">+</span> null is null. In this way, missing information results in an unknown result. There are exceptions to this rule, notably the logical operators, and the null-handling operators. The behavior for these operators (and others that do not follow this rule) are described in detail in the documentation for each operator.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>context</em> associated with each ExpressionDef is important here, as it provides a filter on the set of data returned as described by the model. For example, in the <code>Patient</code> context, only data for a specific patient should be returned, and the unique id of that patient must be provided by the evaluation environment.

<p>Evaluation consists of two phases, a <em>pre-processing</em> phase, and an <em>evaluation</em> phase. The pre-processing phase is used to determine the initial data requirements for a rule. During this phase any retrieve expressions in the rule are analyzed to determine what data must be provided to the evaluation in order to successfully complete a rule evaluation. This set of data descriptors is produced using the method described in the <a href="#artifact-data-requirements">Artifact Data Requirements</a> (5.1.3) section. This means in particular that only retrieves whose Codes and DateRange expressions are compile-time evaluable should be considered to determine initial data requirements. This means that these expressions may not reference any clinical information, though they are allowed to reference parameter values.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, query evaluation can be performed in many different ways, especially when queries involve large numbers of sources. Rather than address the many ways queries could be evaluated, the intent of this section is to describe the expected semantics for query evaluation, regardless of how the underlying implementation actually executes any given query.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The outline of the process is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluate the sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each item in the source</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>evaluate any let clauses within the query</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate each with or without clause in the query</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the where clause, if present</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the return clause, if present</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate the aggregate clause, if present, storing the result as an accumulator available for reference in the next iteration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort the results if a sort clause is present</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections discuss each of these steps in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="evaluate-sources"><a class="anchor" href="#evaluate-sources"></a>3.1. Evaluate Sources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step in evaluation of a given query is to establish the query sources. Conceptually, this step involves generating the cartesian product of all the sources involved. In a single-source query, this is simply the source. But for a multi-source query, the evaluation needs to be performed for every possible combination of the sources involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How this actually occurs is up to the specific implementation, but note that the evaluation must still be able to reference components originating from each individual source using the alias for the source defined in the query. A simple solution to allowing this is to define the query source internally as a list of tuples, each with an element for each source whose value is the tuple from that source. This list is then simply populated with the cartesian product of all sources, and alias access within the rest of the query can be implemented as tuple-element access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that although this discussion generally treats sources as lists, query sources in general may be singleton values as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="iteration"><a class="anchor" href="#iteration"></a>3.2. Iteration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the source for the query has been established, the iterative clauses must be evaluated for each element of the source, in order, as described in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="let-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#let-clause"></a>3.2.1. Let Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The let clause, if present, allows a CQL author to introduce expression definitions scoped to the query scope. For each definition specified in the let clause, the result of the expression is evaluated and made available within the query scope such that subsequent clauses can access the value. Note that an implementation may opt for lazy evaluation, saving the cost of evaluating an expression that is never actually referenced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="with-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#with-clause"></a>3.2.2. With Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each with clause present in the query acts as a filter to remove items from the result if they do not satisfy the conditions of the with clause. Evaluation proceeds by introducing the related source into the query scope and evaluating the “such that” condition of the with clause for each element of the introduced source. If no element of the introduced source satisfies the such that condition, the current row of the query source is filtered out of the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that because this is a positive existence condition, the test can stop after the first positive result. Only in the case of a negative result would all the elements of the introduced source need to be processed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="without-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#without-clause"></a>3.2.3. Without Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each without clause present in the query acts as a filter to remove items from the result if they satisfy the conditions of the without clause. This is the opposite of the with clause. Evaluation proceeds the same way as a with clause, except that an element from the query source will only pass the filter if there a no rows from the introduced source that satisfy the conditions of the without clause.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="where-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#where-clause"></a>3.2.4. Where Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The where clause, if present simply determines whether each element should be included in the result. If the condition evaluates to true, the element is included. Otherwise, the element is excluded from the result.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="return-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#return-clause"></a>3.2.5. Return Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The return clause, if present, defines the final shape of each element produced by the query, as well as whether or not to eliminate duplicates from the result. If distinct is specified as part of the return clause, any duplicates must not appear in the result set. The expression defined in the return clause is evaluated and the result is added to the output. If neither all or distinct is specified, distinct is the default behavior.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="aggregate-clause"><a class="anchor" href="#aggregate-clause"></a>3.2.6. Aggregate Clause</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The aggregate clause, if present, defines the final result of the query in terms of an expression that is evaluated for each item. If distinct is specified, it is applied to the items in the query prior to aggregation. For aggregation, an accumulator tracking the result of the aggregation is created, and named according to the identifier element of the aggregate clause. If a starting expression is specified, the accumulator is initialized to the result of evaluating the starting expression. For each item in the query, the aggregation expression is evaluated, and the result replaces the current value of the accumulator. Once the iteration is complete, the accumulator is returned as the result of the query.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="sort"><a class="anchor" href="#sort"></a>3.3. Sort</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the iterative clauses are executed for each element of the query source, the sort clause, if present, specifies a sort order for the final output. This step simply involves sorting the output of the iterative steps by the conditions defined in the sort clause. This may involve sorting by a particular element of the result tuples, or it may simply involve sorting the resulting list by the defined comparison for the data type (for example, if the result of the query is simply a list of integers).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="implementing-query-evaluation"><a class="anchor" href="#implementing-query-evaluation"></a>3.4. Implementing Query Evaluation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is worth noting that the implementation of query evaluation can be simplified by decomposing the query into a set of more primitive operations. For example, the following operations are sufficient to evaluate any query of CQL:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ForEach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distinct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sketch details an implementation plan for any query using these primitives:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>For each query source beyond the first, use a Times operation to produce a result with a tuple for each combination, named the same as the alias used to introduce the source in the query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the let clause is present, use a ForEach operation to introduce a tuple element for each defined expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each with clause, use a Filter and express the with in terms of an Exists in the condition of the Filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each without clause, use a Filter and express the without in terms of a Not Exists in the condition of the Filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the return clause is specified, use a ForEach to produce the result of the return. If the return clause specifies Distinct, also attach a Distinct operation to the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the aggregate clause is specified, use an Aggregate to produce the result of the aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the sort clause is specified, use a Sort operation to produce the final sorted output.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this sketch, the evaluation of a query can be performed by pipelining the query into a series of more primitive operations that can be implemented more easily. This approach also lends itself to translation and/or optimization if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="precision-based-timing"><a class="anchor" href="#precision-based-timing"></a>5. Precision-Based Timing</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most complex aspects of quality expression logic is dealing with timing relationships in the presence of partially-specified date and time values. This section discusses the precise semantics used by CQL to help mitigate this complexity and allow measure and decision support authors to express temporal logic intuitively and accurately, even in the presence of uncertain date and time data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core issue being addressed is the proper handling of temporal comparisons in the presence of varying degrees of certainty about the time at which events occur. For example, a measure is looking for the occurrence of a particular procedure within two years of the measurement start date, but an EHR records that a qualifying procedure occurred in a given year, not the month or day of the occurrence. In this scenario, the EHR must be allowed to provide as much information as it accurately has, but must not be required to provide information that is not known. This requirement means that the record will contain a date and time value, but specified only to the year precision. If the semantics for timing comparison do not take this possibility into account, the resulting comparisons may yield incorrect results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the approach taken by CQL formally defines the notion of <em>uncertainty</em> to specify the semantics for date and time comparisons, and all the operations that rely on them. In particular, the approach described here applies to operators defined for the <span class="id">Date</span>, <span class="id">DateTime</span>, and <span class="id">Time</span> types, the only difference between them being the precisions that must be considered. Note that the concept of uncertainty is not exposed directly in CQL or in ELM, but is defined as an implementation detail. This approach is deliberate and is taken to achieve the intuitively correct semantics without exposing the complexity involved to CQL authors and developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The discussion here begins by formally defining uncertainty and the semantics of operations involving uncertainty. The calculation of duration between imprecise dates is then discussed in terms of uncertainty, and then the CQL timing phrases are all defined in terms of either date and time comparison, or duration calculation. The discussion concludes with some notes on implementation of these semantics within an engine or translated environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="uncertainty"><a class="anchor" href="#uncertainty"></a>5.1. Uncertainty</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formally, an <em>uncertainty</em> is a closed interval over a given point type, with specific semantics defined for comparison operators. For simplicity, we use the point type Integer in the discussion that follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intuitively, an uncertainty between X and Y means <em>some value between X and Y</em>. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>uncertainty[1, 10]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This uncertainty means <em>some value between 1 and 10</em>. Note that this representation of uncertainty assumes a continuous probability distribution along the range. In other words, the assumption is that there is no information about how likely the value is to be any particular value within the range.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the special case of an uncertainty of width zero:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>uncertainty[1, 1]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Must be treated as equivalent to the point value, 1 in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="comparison-operators-2"><a class="anchor" href="#comparison-operators-2"></a>5.1.1. Comparison Operators</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Comparison semantics for uncertainty are defined to result in the intuitively expected behavior. For example, when comparing two uncertainties for equality:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[1, 10] = uncertainty[1, 10]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above expression results in <em>null</em>, because the meaning of the statement is actually:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is <em>some value between 1 and 10</em> equal to <em>some value between 1 and 10</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the intuitively correct answer to that question is, <em>I don’t know</em>. However, for cases where there is no overlap between the uncertainties, the result is <em>false</em>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[1, 10] = uncertainty[21, 30]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, the intended semantics of this statement are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is <em>some value between 1 and 10</em> equal to <em>some value between 21 and 30</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the correct answer is, <em>No</em>, because there is no possible value in either uncertainty range that could evaluate to <em>true</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the special case of equality comparisons of two uncertainties of width zero, the result is true:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[2, 2] = uncertainty[2, 2]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This expression can be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is <em>some value between 2 and 2</em> equal to <em>some value between 2 and 2</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the correct answer is, <em>Yes</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More precisely, given an uncertainty <em>A</em> with range <em>A<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>A<sub>high</sub></em>, and uncertainty <em>B</em> with range <em>B<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>B<sub>high</sub></em>, the comparison:</p>

    then true
    else null
  else false</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For relative comparisons, again, the semantics are defined to give the intuitively correct answer given the intended meaning of uncertainty. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[30, 40] &lt; uncertainty[50, 60]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This expression can be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Is some value between 30 and 40 less than some value between 50 and 60?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the correct answer is, <em>Yes</em>. If the ranges overlap:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[30, 40] &lt; uncertainty[35, 45]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then the result is <em>null</em>, with one exception having to do with boundaries. Consider the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[30, 40] &lt; uncertainty[20, 30]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This expression can be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Is some value between 30 and 40 less than some value between 20 and 30?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the correct answer is, <em>No</em>, because even though the ranges overlap (by width one at the lower boundary of the left-hand value), the result would still be false because 30 is not less than 30.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More precisely, given an uncertainty <em>A</em> with range <em>A<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>A<sub>high</sub></em>, and uncertainty <em>B</em> with range <em>B<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>B<sub>high</sub></em>, the comparison:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">A &lt; B</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is equivalent to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">case

  when A~low~ &gt;= B~high~ then false
  else null
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally, for relative comparisons involving equality, consider the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[30, 40] &lt;= uncertainty[40, 50]</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This expression can be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Is some value between 30 and 40 less than or equal to some value between 40 and 50?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And the correct answer is, <em>Yes</em>, because every possible value between 30 and 40 inclusive is either less than or equal to every possible value between 40 and 50 inclusive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More precisely, given an uncertainty <em>A</em> with range <em>A<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>A<sub>high</sub></em>, and uncertainty <em>B</em> with range <em>B<sub>low</sub></em> to <em>B<sub>high</sub></em>, the comparison:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

  else null

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note carefully that these semantics introduce some asymmetries into the comparison operators. In particular, <em>A <span class="sym">=</span> B or A <span class="sym">&lt;</span> B</em> is <em>not</em> equivalent to <em>A <span class="sym">&lt;=</span> B</em> because of the uncertainty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="arithmetic-operators-2"><a class="anchor" href="#arithmetic-operators-2"></a>5.1.2. Arithmetic Operators</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to comparison operators, the basic arithmetic operators are defined for uncertainty, again based on the intuitively expected semantics. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[17, 44] + uncertainty[5, 10] // returns uncertainty[22, 54]</code></pre>

<p>The above expression can be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>some value between 17 and 44</em> <span class="sym">+</span> <em>some value between 5 and 10</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this calculation simply adds the respective boundaries to determine what the range of possible values of this calculation would be, in this case <em>some value between 22 and 54</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly for multiplication:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[17, 44] * uncertainty[2, 4] // returns uncertainty[34, 176]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of this calculation multiplies the boundaries of the uncertainties to determine the range of possible values for the result, in this case <em>some value between 34 and 176</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implicit-conversion"><a class="anchor" href="#implicit-conversion"></a>5.1.3. Implicit Conversion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important step to achieving the intended semantics for precision-based timing comparisons in CQL is to allow for implicit conversion between uncertainties and point-values. This means that anywhere an uncertainty is involved in an operation with a point-value, the point-value will be implicitly converted to an uncertainty of width zero and the uncertainty semantics defined above are then used to perform the calculation. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[17, 44] &gt; 2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point-value of <em>2</em> in this example is implicitly converted to an uncertainty of width zero:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">uncertainty[17, 44] &gt; uncertainty[2, 2]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This implicit conversion means that in general, the notion of uncertainty will not be visible in the resulting syntax of CQL. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2) &gt; 2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though determining the correct answer to this question involves the use of uncertainty, it is implicit in the way the operations are defined, and does not surface to the CQL authors.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="determining-difference-and-duration"><a class="anchor" href="#determining-difference-and-duration"></a>5.2. Determining Difference and Duration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To determine the duration between two date or time values, CQL supports a <em>between</em> operator for each date and time component. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between A and B</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This expression returns the number of whole days between A and B. If A is before B, the result will be a positive integer. If A is after B, the result will be a negative integer. And if A is the same day as B, the result will be zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, to support the case where one or the other comparand in the duration operation does not specify components to the level of precision being determined, the between operator does not return a strict integer, it returns an <em>uncertainty</em>, which is defined as a range of values, similar to an interval. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The number of days between these two dates cannot be determined reliably, but a definite range of possible values can be determined. The lower bound of that range is found by determining the duration between the maximum possible value of the first comparand and the minimum possible value of the second comparand; and the upper bound is determined using the minimum possible value of the first comparand and the maximum possible value of the second:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2, 1) // 17 days
days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2, 28) // 44 days</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intuitively, what this means is that the number of days between January 15<sup>th</sup>, 2014 and some date in February, 2014, is no less than 17 days, but no more than 44. By incorporating this information into an uncertainty, CQL can support the intuitively expected semantics when performing timing comparisons. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2) &gt; 2</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This comparison returns true, because the lower bound of the uncertainty, 17, is greater than 2, so no matter what the actual date of the second comparand, it would always be at least 17 days. By contrast:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2) &gt; 50</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This comparison returns false, because the upper bound of the uncertainty, 44, is less than 50, so no matter what the actual date of the second comparand, it would always be at most 44 days. And finally:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between Date(2014, 1, 15) and Date(2014, 2) &gt; 20</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This comparison returns unknown (null), because the value being compared, 20, falls within the uncertainty, so no determination can be reliably made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As another example, consider the case when a duration is being computed between DateTime values of different precisions:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between @2017-08-07T17:00 and @2017-08-14T // [6, 7]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This duration results in an uncertainty because the starting datetime value is specified to the minute, <code>17:00</code>, while the second value is only specified to the day. The resulting uncertainty interval is between 6 and 7 days, and so <code>[6,7]</code> is returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Uncertainties may also result when calculating duration for a finer precision than what is specified in the input values. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">days between @2012-01 and @2012-02

// Results in an uncertainty from the shortest possible duration, to the longest possible duration
// [days between @2012-01-31 and @2012-02-01, days between @2012-01-01 and @2012-02-29]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the datetime values are both only specified to the month (from January of 2012 to February of 2012), the result is an uncertainty interval beginning with the number of days between the 31st of January, 2012 and the 1st of February, 2012 (the shortest possible duration), and ending with the number of days between the 1st of January, 2012 and the 29th of February, 2012 (the longest possible duration).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CQL also supports a difference in operator which, rather than calculating the number of calendar periods between two dates, calculates the number of boundaries crossed between the two dates. As with the duration operator, difference is defined to take imprecision in date and time values into account by returning an uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that uncertainty calculations, just like date and time comparison calculations, consider seconds and milliseconds as a single combined precision with decimal semantics. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">hours between @2012-01-01T01:00:00 and @2012-01-01T02:00:00.0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above example results in <span class="sym">1</span>, even though the second argument is specified to milliseconds and the first argument is only specified to seconds.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="timing-phrases"><a class="anchor" href="#timing-phrases"></a>5.3. Timing Phrases</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the foundational elements described in the previous sections, the semantics for the various CQL timing phrases can now be described in detail. The general approach for each timing phrase is to transform it to an equivalent representation in terms of either a direct comparison, or a comparison involving a duration calculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="same-as"><a class="anchor" href="#same-as"></a>5.3.1. Same As</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>same as</em> timing phrase is simply defined to be equivalent to a <em>same as</em> comparison of the date and time values involved:</p>

start of A same as start of B + 3 days</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that these calculations use date/time arithmetic, applying <em>duration</em>, not <em>difference</em> semantics for the comparison.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For timing phrases involving relative comparison, the prefixes <em>less than</em> and <em>more than</em>, as well as the suffixes <em>or more</em> and <em>or less</em> can be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">A starts 3 days or more before start B
A starts more than 3 days before start B

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the addition of the null test in the case that an interval is constructed from the point B.

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="within"><a class="anchor" href="#within"></a>5.3.3. Within</h4>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that as with the before and after transformations, a null test is required here because if B is null, then the constructed interval would be incorrectly interpreted as continuing to the beginning or end of time (depending on whether the null appears as the starting or ending boundary of the interval).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="interval-operators-1"><a class="anchor" href="#interval-operators-1"></a>5.3.4. Interval Operators</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, interval comparisons are already defined in terms of the fundamental comparison operators (<span class="sym">=</span>, <span class="sym">&gt;</span>, <span class="sym">&lt;</span>, <span class="sym">&gt;=</span>, <span class="sym">&lt;=</span>, and the precision-based counterparts) so the semantics of the interval comparisons follow directly from these extended semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that open null boundaries of intervals are treaterd as uncertainties for the purposes of interval computation. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">intersect Interval[1, 10] intersect Interval[5, null)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This results in an interval that begins at 5, and ends at some value between 5 and 10. Implementations can accomplish this by normalizing open intervals to closed intervals with uncertain boundaries:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-pseudo-code" data-lang="pseudo-code">  if interval.low is null then interval.low = Uncertainty(minimumValue, interval.high)
  if interval.high is null then interval.high = Uncertainty(interval.low, maximumValue)</code></pre>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="implementing-precision-based-timing-with-uncertainty"><a class="anchor" href="#implementing-precision-based-timing-with-uncertainty"></a>5.4. Implementing Precision-Based Timing with Uncertainty</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementation of these semantics can be simplified by recognizing that all the date and time comparisons can be expressed in terms of a difference calculation and a comparison of the resulting (potentially uncertain) values against 0. Combined with the timing phrase translations, this means that the implementation for precision-based timing can be isolated to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Support for run-time operations on integer-based uncertainties, including:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="sym">=</span>, <span class="sym">&lt;</span>, <span class="sym">&gt;</span>, <span class="sym">&lt;=</span>, <span class="sym">&gt;=</span>, <span class="sym">+</span>, <span class="sym">-</span>, <span class="sym">unary +/-</span>, <span class="sym">*</span>, <span class="sym">/</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implicit conversion between integer point values and uncertainties</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precision-based duration and difference between dates and times</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the other operations and semantics can be achieved using only these primitives. For example, given <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, both datetime values, the comparison:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">A &gt; B</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can be evaluated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">difference in milliseconds between A and B &gt; 0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">A same day as B</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can be evaluated as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cql" data-lang="cql">difference in days between A and B = 0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the difference operation will return an uncertainty when imprecise date and time values are involved, the correct semantics will be applied to the comparison to the point value, 0 in this case. By structuring the evaluation engine such that all operations involving dates and times are performed in terms of these primitives, correct semantics can be achieved with a comparatively straightforward implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note also that a compile-time implicit conversion to uncertainty may also simplify the implementation, avoiding the need for integer-valued primitives to determine at run-time whether they are operating on an uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that with an increased burden on implementation, uncertainty resolution could likely be more robust. For example, consider the following statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DateTime(2014) + 364 days</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above example, it is almost certainly the case that the result of the addition would result in some date in DateTime(2015). However, CQL currently would return a DateTime(2014) because the addition does not result in a whole calendar period for the specified precision. An argument could be made that uncertainty resolution could be more robust as DateTime(2014) is an undefined DateTime occurring sometime during 2014, which can be represented as the following interval:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[@2014-01-01T00:00:00.000, @2014-12-31T23:59:59.999]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, it is relevant to consider that the above addition could be added to the interval above resulting in the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[@2014-12-31T00:00:00.000, @2015-12-30T23:59:59.999]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this behavior would potentially result in a significant implementation burden and represent a significant misalignment with FHIRPath if CQL were to adopt this behavior.</p>
